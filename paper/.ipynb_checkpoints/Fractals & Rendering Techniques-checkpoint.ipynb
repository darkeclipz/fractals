    "First we start by explaining what shaders are and how you can program them in GLSL. Then we will do a quick refresh on the math that is required for complex numbers. If you think that math is not your thing, the functions to do the complex arithmetic in GLSL are implemented in this document and you can simply copy them. However, after the Mandelbrot section there is no more escaping from the math, and basic knowledge of algebra, vectors, and matrices will help tremendously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Armed with the knowledge of basic GLSL programming and complex numbers, we will start to render the Mandelbrot set. The core ideas of rendering fractals are explained here. When we have a rendering of the set, we will explore a technique for coloring. The coloring technique is developed by _Iniqo Quilez_, and I think it is so simple and powerful that any programmer can benefit from it. To complete the rendering program, we will also implement supersampling. With supersampling we are 'measuring' multiple points in the pixel and average them out to get the final color. This gives an anti-aliasing effect, where jagged edges become more smooth (less pixelized look).\n",

In a complex number, $a$ is called the _real_ component, and $b$ is called the _imaginary_ component. Like normal arithmetic, the rules for addition and multiplication have been defined for complex numbers. However, for complex numbers the arithmetic is differently from what you are used to do with real numbers. How to do the arithmetic with complex numbers is explained in a later section. Another notation that is used in complex numbers is $\\textrm{Re}(z)$ to refer to the real component, and $\\textrm{Im}(z)$ to refer to the imaginary component. This means that a complex numbers can also be written as $z=\\textrm{Re}(z) + i\\ \\textrm{Im}(z)$. "
